    No dependencies or assumptions were used in this code

# q2.c
    Assumtion:
    The segment numbers (12-15) in the Virtual Address given are used to map to Code, Heap and Stack
    as no specific mapping of segment numbers was mentioned in the question. There's no universal rule 
    that segment numbers dircetly map to code,heap or stack but it was a mere assumption.
    Segment Numbers [0,5] map to Code segment
    Segment Numbers [6,10] map to Heap segment
    Segment Numbers [11,15] map to Stack segment
    (both inclusive)
